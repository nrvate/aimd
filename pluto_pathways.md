Here are 10 ways Silas's journey to evolve Pluto transformed him internally, with correlations to modern psychology:

1. **From Ego to Self:** Silas moved from an inflated ego, driven by external validation and a need to control, to a more authentic sense of self, rooted in connection and purpose. This aligns with concepts in **Humanistic Psychology** which emphasizes self-actualization, personal growth, and finding meaning beyond external rewards. 

2. **From Defense Mechanisms to Acceptance:** His initial ambition and ruthlessness can be viewed as defense mechanisms (e.g., denial, projection) to protect himself from vulnerability and insecurity. His fall forced him to confront these defenses and embrace a more authentic, vulnerable self. This aligns with **Psychodynamic Psychology** which explores the unconscious mind and the impact of early experiences on personality development.

3. **From Controlling to Embracing Flow:**  His shift from a need for control to acceptance of the natural flow of life resonates with **Positive Psychology** which emphasizes the importance of finding meaning and purpose through acceptance, gratitude, and focusing on strengths.

4. **From Materialism to Mindfulness:**  His shift from material obsession to finding meaning in nature aligns with mindfulness practices that focus on present-moment awareness and appreciating the simple beauty of life. This aligns with concepts in **Mindfulness-Based Therapies** which emphasize the cultivation of awareness, acceptance, and a connection to the present moment.

5. **From Dissociation to Integration:**  Silas's initial success was likely accompanied by a degree of dissociation, separating his actions from their consequences. His journey forced him to integrate his shadow self, acknowledging the impact of his actions and taking responsibility for his behavior. This resonates with the concept of **Ego Integration** in **Jungian Psychology**,  where individuals confront their shadow aspects to achieve wholeness.

6. **From Fear of Vulnerability to Embrace of Empathy:** His initial fear of vulnerability and rejection gave way to a deeper capacity for empathy. He learned to see the world through the eyes of others, understanding their pain and celebrating their strengths. This aligns with theories of **Attachment and Relational Psychology** which emphasize the importance of secure attachments and empathic relationships for mental well-being.

7. **From Fear of Loss to Appreciation of Impermanence:**  His experience of loss helped him overcome the fear of impermanence and embrace the beauty of fleeting moments. This aligns with concepts in **Existential Psychology** which emphasizes the acceptance of mortality and the search for meaning in a finite world.

8. **From Power Over to Power With:** His power dynamics shifted from a need to control and dominate to a more collaborative approach, recognizing the power of working with others for a common good. This aligns with concepts in **Social Psychology** which explores the ways in which individuals influence and are influenced by others within social groups. 

9. **From Self-Absorption to Connection:** His journey emphasized a shift from self-absorption to a sense of belonging and connection with a larger community.  This resonates with the concept of **Interdependence** in **Humanistic Psychology**,  recognizing that our well-being is intertwined with the well-being of others.

10. **From Linear Growth to Cyclical Transformation:**  Silas's journey was not simply linear growth, but a cyclical process of destruction, introspection, and rebirth. This aligns with the concept of **Spiral Dynamics** which suggests that human development occurs through a series of stages, each requiring a breakdown of old structures and a reintegration of new perspectives.
